# Solving_differential_equations_numerically
numericalDEsolver.py is a python program made to solve any second order differential equation numerically and plot the solution(plot and animate).
This solver can be used to visualize many situations in physics where analytical solutions either do not exist or are too complicated to work with. 
One application considers a real life pendulum , modelling the problem gives rise to a non linean differential equation that is impossible to solve, we usually take the small angle approximation but that is only applicable to small angles, if we want to study its motion for extreme initial conditions we have no other way that doing a numerical analysis and solving the equation with computer. 
An animation is attached with the code showing the motion, velocity and acceleration plots of the pendulum starting from an obtuse initial angle to showcase the prowess of numerical analysis.
Any second order non linear system can be solved with this program.
